# NodeJS TypeScript + Express + Passport JWT Boilerplate

"tsc" — create a /build folder and converts all your .ts to .jsfiles.  
"ts-node" — allows node to run .ts projects. Not recommended for production uses.  
"ts-node-dev" — same as above, but allows you restart the node server every time you change a file.
